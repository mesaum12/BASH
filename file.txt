Hello! This is Saurabh Mukherjee
The purpose of this file is to count
the number of lines present in this file and 
then display it as an output on the terminal 
.The bash script has been written for the purpose.
We are taking the name of the file and then counting the 
lines till we encounter the end of the file and then increment the 
counter each time we find a new line.
